# Miner Configuration
## When `start_miner` is true, it will start a dummy miner to generate
## blocks based `block_time`; Otherwise no miner be started.
##
## As for staging/testnet/mainnet networks, these networks have their owned miners,
## so `start_miner` should be set to false;
## as for personal dummy network, `start_miner` setted to true is convenion
